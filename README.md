Here, you'll find a collection of my Java mini-projects, created to refine my programming skills, 
deepen my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) fundamentals, and apply the principles of 3-layer design.

Each project demonstrates my commitment to learning, problem-solving, and building clean, efficient, and scalable code.

I hope you enjoy them!
